       <p>About Me</p> 
     
       
      
     <p>
Hello Everyone!
I am a future web developer, so currently a student of the craft. I live in Miami, Florida, and I was born and raised in the rural parts of Cuba, so it's safe to say I often miss the outdoors and the farm life.
I love to busy myself out in the water with a paddle board early mornings or at the mechanical wake park - practicing new wakeboarding tricks. 
Often, you'll find me teaching myself foreign languages. The world fascinates me, and I want to communicate with as many people from different cultures as I possibly can. 
My favorite languages are Norwegian, German, and French. Since I'm completely new to the tech world, I can say I'm learning to love working with Html, Css, and Javascript. 
This field interests me because it's an incredible platform to create connection with people and express my creativity. Plus, I'm ready to welcome programming languages into my life as well. Wish me luck, and let the fun begin!
